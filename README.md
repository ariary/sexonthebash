## 🔦 Idea

Provide a different approach for keylogging (log only command on `bash`). But some juicy information could be grabbed from it.

The aim of `sexonthebash` is to be launched under a bash session by any means and to imitate bash behaviour to lure the victim in a way that the victim doesn't feel like they're somewhere other than a bash session.
 In fact it receives all `stdin` data, send the data to bash as a command, retrieves output from stdout and redirect it to the victim
